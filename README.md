# CTMRG for the 2D Ising model

Simulate the 2D ising model with the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalisation Group (CTMRG) algorithm [1]. The parameters are fixed in the data.txt file and the magnetisation is saved in the figure folder.

To run the code, use the following command:

```
python main.py --input parameters.txt
```
